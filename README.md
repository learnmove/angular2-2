# Angular 2 Introduction
# Description
This repository contains all the source code of my YouTube Angular 2 Course: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL55RiY5tL51olfU2IEqr455EYLkrhmh3n

Currently only the most recent version of the code is available on GitHub. I'll try to add subfolders for individual lectures in the future.

## Get started
To get started, be sure to download my Angular 2 boilerplate: https://github.com/mschwarzmueller/angular-2-beta-boilerplate
